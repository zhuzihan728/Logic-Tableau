# logicTableau
Yr2 logic coursework with a test

# Usage
- `gcc tableau.c; ./a.out`  
This will run the tableau checker which takes input.txt, which contains lines of Propositional formula as input, and output output.txt which suggests the satisfiability of those formulas.

# Test
A little test to test if the checker runs correctly. 
## Usage
- navigate to `\test`
- run `python3 in.py` to generate tons of Propositional formulas
- run `python3 compare.py` to compare if the two checkers' outputs against the formulas are the same.
