# Logic Tableau
Yr2 logic coursework with a test

# Usage
- `gcc tableau.c; ./a.out`  
This will run the tableau checker which takes input.txt, which contains lines of Propositional formula as input, and outputs output.txt which suggests the satisfiability of those formulas.

# Test
A little test to test if the checker runs correctly. 
## Usage
- navigate to `\test`
- run `python3 in.py` to generate tons of Propositional formulas.
- run `python3 compare.py` 

  It runs two checkers, and compares their outputs from those formulas, if the outputs are the same, it probably means the two checkers are    implemented correctly.
